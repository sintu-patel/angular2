So if we dates back to 300 years ago, Taiwan used to be independent, as an island. But that doesnâ€™t make much sense to me. There is no exile goverment for local Taiwanese now. And if Taiwan go independent in this sense, how should we deal with Kinmen and Matsu, aka, the Fujian province in free area?",
